            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.
             It is characterised by its black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is used to distinguish it from the
              distantly related red panda. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m 
              (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is 
              white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which
               helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to 
               meet their dietary requirements.

            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
                 called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over 
                 14,000 years ago. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that 
                 hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of 
                 agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of 
                 domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate
                  for other 
                canids.[4]</p>

                <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated 
                    carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in 
                    archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East 
                    around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral
                     cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the 
                     cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, 
                     flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well 
                     developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. 
                     Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and 
                     grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for 
                     human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae . They are classified
             as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they
              are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern
               Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of
                North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears 
                include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, 
                plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and 
                India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a
                 dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are
                  larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups 
                  called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and 
                  cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
                  The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when 
                  opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively
                   seek out and prey on humans.

            <p>
                The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent
                 native to South America. It is the largest living rodent[2] and a member of the genus
                  Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara 
                  (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and 
                  it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. 
                  The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. 
                  It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, 
                  but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat 
                  and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3]

                Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also includes the hares), 
                which is in the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). The European rabbit, 
                 cuniculus is the ancestor of the world's hundreds of breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. 
                 Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail.
                  The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is 
                  familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock and 
                  a pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, in many areas of the world, 
                  the rabbit is a part of daily life as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of 
                  artistic inspiration.
