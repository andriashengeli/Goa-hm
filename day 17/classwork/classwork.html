        <p>
            Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the 
            mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it
             every day,
             depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones
             that function
             as opposable thumbs.
